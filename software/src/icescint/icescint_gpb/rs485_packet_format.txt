RS485 Protocol Definition for Icescint General Purpose Board
============================================================

The protocol support two modes:
 - textual console interface type (cli) for direct connection from a terminal
 - framed binary data format for automated software communication

RS485 Half Duplex Operation
---------------------------
The serial connection is a half duplex, master to slave connection using 
  9600 baud,8bit,1stop bit.

A strict request-reply communication is defined. 

The master starts a communication by sending 1 ore more bytes and the slave 
does answer in defined pattern.

cli communication mode
----------------------

The clie communication toggles between "command line mode", where the user 
enters a command, and "command response mode" where the slave answers with 
the requested data. In cli mode everything is humand readable.

command line mode:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After each character transfered (key pressed in terminal), the slave sends 
back the character that was received. That required the user to type commands
in normal typing speed. Each character requires 20ms processing time, before 
another character can be send.  

command response mode:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the master sends a windows style line feed a.k.a "/r/n". The slave 
enters into sending mode and can answer with multiple lines seperated by
windows-style line feeds.
      
Binary packet mode a.k.a binary framed mode
-------------------------------------------

The binary payload is "framed" with a header sequence, size information 
and a tailer:

  [header sequence] [size] [data byte 1] [data byte 2] ... [data byte N] [tailer sequence]
 
Binary mode is activated by sending the header of a binary frame followed 
by the size, packet data and a packet tailer. The packet format is as follwing:

  packet header 	2 bytes : 0xCA 0xFE
  packet size   	1 byte  : xx
  packet type   	1 byte  : xx
  packet data   	xx bytes: [....]
  packet checksum   1 byte  : xx
  packet tailer 	2 bytes : 0xEF 0xAF
   
max allowed packet size is 264 bytes (including frame)

Binary Packet Payload Format
----------------------------

The binary packet contains a payload that is binary. 

The first byte in the payload defines the data type.

The following data types are defined:
